        If you can feel an onset of anxiety at that thought already, rest assured you’re not alone. An arguably healthy
        wariness of strangers is built into our genes, and we all get to experience it as children. Still, that fear
        will stay with many of us well into our adulthood as well. Studies have shown that being around strangers raises
        our levels of cortisol, a hormone that produces stress responses and makes us less empathetic.
        <span>I AM SPAN !!! </span> Your brain isidentifying this as a “stranger danger” situation, and it responds by
        trying to minimize the
        exposure of yourthoughts and vulnerabilities in the face of potentially threatening outside influences.
